      "\n",
      "1.  **Neurochemical Flood:** Orgasm triggers the release of several key neurochemicals:\n",
      "    *   **Dopamine:** A \"reward\" hormone that creates feelings of intense pleasure and satisfaction.\n",
      "    *   **Oxytocin:** Often called the \"bonding hormone,\" it promotes feelings of calm, well-being, and connection (even if self-directed).\n",
      "    *   **Endorphins:** Natural pain relievers that induce euphoria and a general sense of contentment.\n",
      "    *   **Prolactin:** Associated with feelings of satiety, relaxation, and often, post-orgasmic sleepiness.\n",
      "2.  **Physical Relaxation:** Following the rhythmic muscle contractions of orgasm, the body experiences widespread muscle relaxation, contributing to a feeling of limpness and ease.\n",
      "3.  **Psychological Relief:** The culmination of sexual tension in orgasm provides significant mental relief, reducing stress and anxiety, and leaving a sense of calm and contentment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, it's a profound feeling of **satisfaction, relaxation, and emotional calm** driven by a potent cocktail of \"feel-good\" brain chemicals and the release of accumulated physical tension. This experience is largely similar for both men and women.\n"
